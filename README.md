Awaken spring.

This is an entry in the [PyWeek 29](https://pyweek.org/29/) challenge.

## Controls

Use the mouse to navigate, click (or press shift) to gain speed.

Gamepad controls are also supported.  The menus require a D-Pad.  Use either stick to turn, and hold trigger, or A, to speed.

## Running from source

Requires Python 3 and Panda3D 1.10.6, plus a few other libraries.  I recommend installing them via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run, simply cd to the directory containing the game and type:
```
python run_game.py
```
